# Optional environment variable configuration for the UI Service

The following are optional environment variables that can be used to fine-tune the behavior of specific components of the UI service if necessary. 

  - [Web socket message retention](#web-socket-message-retention)
  - [Cache and data preload limits](#cache-and-data-preload-limits)
  - [Feature flags](#feature-flags)
  - [Heartbeat intervals](#heartbeat-intervals)
  - [Baseurl configuration](#baseurl-configuration)
  - [Custom navigation links for UI](#custom-navigation-links-for-ui)
  - [System notifications for UI](#system-notifications-for-ui)
  - [Log content restriction options](#log-content-restriction-options)
  - [Card content restriction](#card-content-restriction)

## Web socket message retention

Configure amount of seconds realtime events are kept in queue (delivered to UI in case of reconnects):

- `WS_QUEUE_TTL_SECONDS` [defaults to 300 (5 minutes)]

## Cache and data limits 

Configure amount of runs to prefetch during server startup (artifact cache):

- `PREFETCH_RUNS_SINCE` [in seconds, defaults to 2 days ago (86400 * 2 seconds)]
- `PREFETCH_RUNS_LIMIT` [defaults to 50]

Configure the amount of concurrent cache actions. This works similar to a database connection pool.

- `CACHE_ARTIFACT_MAX_ACTIONS` [max number of artifact cache actions. Defaults to 16]
- `CACHE_DAG_MAX_ACTIONS` [max number of DAG cache actions. Defaults to 16]

Configure the maximum usable space by the cache:

- `CACHE_ARTIFACT_STORAGE_LIMIT` [in bytes, defaults to 600000]
- `CACHE_DAG_STORAGE_LIMIT` [in bytes, defaults to 100000]

Configure the maximum size of files that should be processed by cache actions:

- `MAX_PROCESSABLE_S3_ARTIFACT_SIZE_KB` [in kilobytes, defaults to 4]

## Feature flags

All environment variables prefixed with `FEATURE_` will be publicly available under `/features` route. These are primarily used to communicate backend feature availability to the UI frontend.

> ```sh
> $ curl http://service:8083/features
> {
>   "FEATURE_CACHE": true,
>   "FEATURE_DAG": false
> }
> ```

Example values:

> ```
> FEATURE_EXAMPLE=1           -> True
> FEATURE_EXAMPLE=true        -> True
> FEATURE_EXAMPLE=t           -> True
> FEATURE_EXAMPLE=anything    -> True
> FEATURE_EXAMPLE=0           -> False
> FEATURE_EXAMPLE=false       -> False
> FEATURE_EXAMPLE=f           -> False
> ```

These feature flags are passed to frontend and can be used to dynamically control features.

## Heartbeat intervals

The threshold parameters for heartbeat checks can also be configured when necessary with the following environment variables.

`HEARTBEAT_THRESHOLD` [controls at what point a heartbeat is considered expired. Default is `WAIT_TIME * 6`]

`OLD_RUN_FAILURE_CUTOFF_TIME` [ for runs that do not have a heartbeat, controls at what point a running status run should be considered failed. Default is 6 days (in milliseconds)]

`RUN_INACTIVE_CUTOFF_TIME` [ for runs that have a heartbeat, controls how long a run with a failed heartbeat should wait for possibly queued tasks to start and resume heartbeat updates. Default is 6 days (in seconds)]

## Baseurl configuration

Use `MF_BASEURL` environment variable to overwrite the default API baseurl.
This affects API responses where meta links are provided as a response.

## Custom Navigation links for UI

You can customize the admin navigation links presented by the UI by creating a `config.custom_quicklinks.json` file on the server. See `example.custom_quicklinks.json` for a reference. Alternatively you can set an environment variable `CUSTOM_QUICKLINKS` for the backend process. The value for the environment variable should be a _stringified_ json of the format:

```json
[
  {
    "href": "https://docs.metaflow.org/",
    "label": "Metaflow documentation"
  },
  {
    "href": "https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow",
    "label": "GitHub"
  }
]
```

You are free to provide as many links as necessary.

**Local Development**
set the `CUSTOM_QUICKLINKS` environment variable

**Prebuilt docker image**
Provide the `CUSTOM_QUICKLINKS` environment variable for the docker run command

```bash
  CUSTOM_QUICKLINKS='[{"href": "https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow", "label": "GitHub"}]' docker run metaflow/ui-service

```

## System Notifications for UI

You can define notifications that are broadcasted to all clients using the UI by creating a `config.notifications.json` file on the server, see `example.notifications.json` for a reference. Alternatively you can set the environment variable `NOTIFICATIONS` for the backend process. The value for the environment variable should be a _stringified_ json of the format:

```json
[
  {
    "created": 1618404534000,
    "message": "Upcoming service maintenance"
  }
]
```

You can provide as many notifications as necessary, topmost item is considered the latest.

Following attributes are supported:

| Attribute     | Description                                                                       | Default value                                 |

Markdown example:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "fixed_id_attribute",
    "type": "info",
    "contentType": "markdown",
    "message": "Upcoming service maintenance [Metaflow](https://metaflow.org)",
    "created": 1618404534000,
    "start": 1618404534000,
    "end": 1618925483000
  }
]
```

Plaintext example:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "fixed_id_attribute",
    "type": "info",
    "contentType": "text",
    "message": "Upcoming service maintenance",
    "url": "https://metaflow.org",
    "urlText": "Metaflow",
    "created": 1618404534000,
    "start": 1618404534000,
    "end": 1618925483000
  }
]
```

## Log content restriction options

The `MF_LOG_LOAD_POLICY` environment variable restricts the amount of log content loaded by the UI. These values are supported:

* `full` (default): loads entire log.
* `tail`: loads the tail of the log only (up to a fixed size by number of characters. See `MF_LOG_LOAD_TAIL_SIZE` below.
* `blurb_only`: does not load the log at all. Instead return Python code snippet to access logs using Metaflow client.

`MF_LOG_LOAD_TAIL_SIZE` may be used when `MF_LOG_LOAD_POLICY=tail`. Returns the last N lines of the log file, where N is maximized without returning more than MF_LOG_LOAD_TAIL_SIZE number of characters. Defaults to `100*1024` characters.

## Card content restriction

The `MF_CARD_LOAD_POLICY` (default `full`) environment variable can be set to `blurb_only` to return a Python code snippet to access card using Metaflow client, instead of loading actual HTML card payload.
